# Generative steganography!

## What is this?
It makes sentences such that the vowel-consonant pattern of the words in the sentence matches the one-zero pattern of an ASCII encoding of an input text! A fun way to hide secret messages.

## Does it work?
Kinda!
* It only works for input of 3-5 characters, and still only sometimes!
* The sentences are not all that good, but they are silly!
* The sentences are all the same grammatical pattern right now!

However, it is a proof-of-concept prototype. I'm working on it!

## How to use?
Run make_encoded_sentence.py and input your text!
